# Mobile Flashcards
> Mobile Flashcards is a flashcard app with a collection of questions/answers. Users can be able to create their personal categories of flashcards called "decks". They can also add cards (question/answer pairs) to the decks, take quizzes and receive scores from the topic they choose.

This project was initially bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). It was built with React Native, Redux and React Native Elements. Redux manages most of the states in this application. It is available on iOS only at this time.
