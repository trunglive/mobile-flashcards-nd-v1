This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

Please install [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view the app.

### `npm install`
Install all dependencies for the project.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode. Then scan the QR code from your phone to load the project.

#### `npm test`
Runs the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) test runner on your tests.

#### `npm run ios`
Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run android`
Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).
